# Projects structure:
### 1. Natural language - projects connected with Natural Language Processing
1.1. NeuroSholohov - trains a Neural Network based on 'Tihii Don' novel and tries to write new text to imitate the style of Mihail Sholohov.

1.2. IntentRecognitionAirlines - classification task - to understand user's intent and generate respective response.

1.3. IntentRecognitionChatbot - chatbot that undestands user's intent from natural language query and responses with predefined answers.

1.4. LSTM calculator - one function calculator. Works based on LSTM Neural 
Network that predicts sequence on result based on sequence of calculation. 

1.5. Sequence prediction - predict sequences of numbers with encoder-decoder 
architecture.

1.6. Dialog-based chatbot - encoder-decoder structure Neural Network for 
chatbot.

### 2. Image recognition - projects connected with Convolutional Neural Networks
2.1. Animal recognition - trains a Convolutional Neural Network to decide 
what animal is on the picture.

### 3. Time series - projects connected with Time Series prediction
