# Projects structure:
### 1. Natural language - projects connected with Natural Language Processing
1.1. NeuroSholohov - trains a Neural Network based on 'Tihii Don' novel and tries to write new text to imitate the style of Mihail Sholohov.

1.2. IntentRecognitionAirlines - classification task - to understand user's intent and generate respective response.

1.3. IntentRecognitionChatbot - chatbot that undestands user's intent from natural language query and responses with predefined answers.

1.4. LSTM calculator - one function calculator. Works based on LSTM Neural 
Network that predicts sequence on result based on sequence of calculation. 

1.5. LSTM calculator - one function calculator. Works based on LSTM Neural 
Network that predicts sequence on result based on sequence of calculation. 

1.6. Sequence prediction - predict sequences of numbers with encoder-decoder 
architecture.
