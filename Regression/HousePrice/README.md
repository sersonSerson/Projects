# 1. Problem definition
## How well can we predict the survivors of Titanic sinking?

# 2. Data
## Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Contains:
1. Train.csv - data for 891 of 1309 passengers with info about their survival. 
   This is the training set for our models.
2. Test.csv - data for 418 of 1309 passengers with no info about survival. 
   This data will be used as a test set. Need to submit data to Kaggle to get the
   score of the prediction.

# 3. Evaluation
## Accuracy score - number of correctly predicted passengers divided by total number of passengers.
