<h1 style="text-align:center; color:#01872A; font-size:30px;background:#daf2e1;border-radius: 20px;">House Prices.</h1>

# Goal: practice using scikit-learn and Tensorflow libraries for regression tasks.
## Size: Large (1910 lines).

# 1. Problem definition

## Predict the price of a house given its features like: area, number of rooms, area of land.

# 2. Data
## House price dataset from Kaggle. Contains:

1. Train.csv - data for 1460 houses with info about their price. 
   This is the training set for our models.

2. Test.csv - data for 1459 houses with no info about their price. 
   This data will be used as a test set. Need to submit data to Kaggle to get the 
   score of the prediction.)

# 3. Evaluation

## The evaluation metric is Root Mean Squared Logaritmic Error (RMSLE).
